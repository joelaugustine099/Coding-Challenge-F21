I used the Symbl.ai API to facilitate a sentiment analysis on the text. I used this API before in a hackathon, and so it was fairly easy to pick up again. The first part of the program gets what is called a conversation ID for the text I input, which I input from the file input.txt. This part works, however when I use this conversation ID to get a topics analysis (which is where the sentiment analysis would be), it doesn't return the sentiment analysis. If you run my code, you get a topics.json file and according to the [Symbl.ai API documentation](https://docs.symbl.ai/docs/conversation-api/get-topics), it should include a sentiment analysis for each topic when the parameter sentiment is set to true. But the output of my program does not output the sentiment analysis. 

This is the first time I made API calls by myself, so I consider this a success to have gotten this far. I am eager to learn more about API calls and programming in general. I want to learn practical knowledge which can only come from actual experience, so I sincerely hope to make the ACM Research team to get this experience.
